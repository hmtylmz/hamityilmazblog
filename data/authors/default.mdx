Hi there! I’m a passionate software developer with a deep love for exploring modern technologies and crafting innovative solutions. Whether it’s building scalable systems or optimizing development workflows, I thrive on tackling new challenges and turning ideas into reality.

Beyond the technical world, I have a keen interest in Stoicism, finance, economics, and psychology. I’m on a journey toward achieving financial freedom and enjoy diving into these fields to learn, grow, and apply new perspectives to my life.

If you’re curious about my story or want to follow along on this journey, stay tuned—you’re more than welcome here!

Start with my first blog post: [Who Am I? A Modern Slave or Nobody?](/blog/who-am-i-a-modern-slave-or-nobody), where I explore the essence of identity and freedom.
