When a friend asked me, "Who are you, aside from your job and hobbies?" I froze for a moment. I'm still thinking about the answer to that question. I had never encountered such a question in my life before. I used to define myself with things like "I'm a software developer" or "I love reading books." But I realized that these are not who I am, they only explain what I do.

Today, in the modern world, people are often valued by the number of followers they have on social media. I’ve never been an active social media user in my life. So, in the eyes of the modern world, I guess I’m "nobody."

A person’s followers, job, or hobbies don’t define who they are. I believe what truly matters is their purpose in life. What do you want to do in this world? What do you aim to achieve?

I am someone who wants to escape the rat race and gain financial freedom. I want to take steps toward this goal. I dream of living location-independently, spending time in various places around the world, and maybe even living in some of them for a while. In other words, I want to be a "digital nomad" or a "new rich" by today's standards.

Perhaps I can define myself this way: A problem-solver, has modest expectations from life, introverted, thinks in shades of gray on most matters, with few red lines,  and a certain level of awareness – a modern slave.
