In today’s world, we are surrounded by countless distractions. Most people grab their phones as soon as they wake up. This habit often leads to hours spent on apps like WhatsApp, Instagram, X, and similar platforms. People have started to prefer short-term, effortless pleasures over long-term, goal-oriented achievements. For example, constantly checking your phone during work hours, binge-watching a Netflix series after work, or choosing a dessert over a healthy lifestyle are all common behaviors.

Research shows that individuals who can delay gratification tend to be more successful in the long run. One of the most well-known experiments demonstrating this is the **Marshmallow Experiment**.

## What is the Marshmallow Experiment?

The Marshmallow Experiment is a self-control and delayed gratification study conducted by psychologist Walter Mischel at Stanford University in the 1960s. This experiment aims to evaluate individuals' ability to postpone immediate rewards in favor of larger future rewards and to explore its relationship with long-term success.

### How the Experiment Works

- **Participants**
  - The experiment typically involves children aged 4–6 years old.
- **Procedure**
  - The children are placed in a room with a marshmallow (or another treat).
  - The experimenter gives the following instructions to the child:
    - If you don’t eat the marshmallow while I’m away, you’ll get another one when I return.
    - If you eat it before I come back, you won’t get a second marshmallow.
  - The child is left alone in the room for a few minutes.
- **Goal**
  - The goal is to observe whether the child can delay short-term gratification for a greater reward.

### Results of the Experiment

- **Behaviors:** Some children ate the marshmallow immediately, while others resisted the temptation and waited for the second reward.
- **Long-Term Findings:** Researchers who extended the experiment into a long-term study found that self-control abilities were linked to success later in life.
  - Children who managed to wait were found to:
    - Achieve higher academic success,
    - Develop better social skills,
    - Experience lower levels of stress.

### Conclusion

The Marshmallow Experiment demonstrates the strong connection between delaying gratification and long-term success. Although we face numerous distractions today, self-control and patience remain essential for individual achievement.

> If you don’t sacrifice for what you want, what you want becomes the sacrifice.
