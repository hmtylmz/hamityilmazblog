## Overview

This guide explains how to deploy a site created with Static Site Generation (SSG) to AWS CloudFront. CloudFront enables efficient, fast access to your site across multiple locations without requiring a dedicated server. However, there are specific steps to consider during deployment: removing .html extensions from files and setting the root file as index.html are crucial.

### Route 53 - Hosted Zones

- Create a new record using "Create hosted zone."
  - Enter "a.com" in the "Domain name" field.

### Domain

- Update the "Name Server" settings at your domain provider with the Name Servers from the Hosted Zone created in Route 53.

### AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

- Request a new certificate using the "Request" option.
  - Enter "a.com" as the "Fully qualified domain name" in the "Domain names" section.

### Route 53 - Hosted Zones

- For the "a.com" domain, add a new record with "Create record."
- Select "CNAME" as the "Record type" and enter the "CNAME value" from the certificate details in the "Value" field.
- Once the certificate is verified, its "Status" will display as "Issued."

### S3 Bucket

- Create a new "bucket" using "Create Bucket."
  - Name it "blog" in the "Bucket name" field.
  - In the "Block Public Access settings for this bucket" section, uncheck "Block all public access."
- After creating the bucket, add the following policy in the "Permissions" tab:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::blog/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Cloudfront Functions

- Create a function by selecting "Create function."
  - Name it "htmlredirect."
```js:FunctionCode
function handler(event) {
    var request = event.request;
    var uri = request.uri;
        if (uri !== '' && uri !== '/' && uri.indexOf('.html') === -1) {
        request.uri = uri + '.html';
    }
    return request;
} 
```
  - Go to the "Publish" tab and select "Publish function."

### Cloudfront Distributions

- Create a new distribution using "Create distribution."
  - Select the "blog" S3 bucket as the "Origin domain."
  - In the "Function associations" section, choose "Viewer request" as "Function type" and select "htmlredirect" for "Function ARN / Name."
  - In the "Settings" section, select the "a.com" domain certificate under "Custom SSL certificate."
  - Set "index.html" as the "Default root object."
- Note the "Distribution ID" and "User ID" in the ARN section of the distribution.

### Route 53 - Hosted zones

- Add a new record for the "a.com" domain using "Create record."
  - Select "A" as the "Record type" and mark "Alias."
  - Under "Choose Endpoint," select "Alias from CloudFront distribution" and choose your distribution.

### Identity and Access Management (IAM) - Policies

- Create a new policy using "Create policy."
```json:Policy
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::blog",
                "arn:aws:s3:::blog/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudfront:CreateInvalidation",
                "cloudfront:GetInvalidation"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudfront::{USER_ID}:distribution/{DISTRIBUTION_ID}"
        }
    ]
}
```
   - Name the policy as "cicdpolicy".

### Identity and Access Management (IAM) - Users

- Create a user with "Create user."
  - Set "User name" as "cicd."
  - Assign permissions using the "cicdpolicy" created in the previous step.
- After adding, go to the "cicd" user.
  - In the "Security credentials" tab, create an access key by selecting "Create access key."
    - Choose Command Line Interface (CLI).
    - Note the "Access ID" and "Access Key."
  
### CICD

- Download the static site application: For example, you can use the [Next.js Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) project.
- Add a "Github Workflow" to the project.
```yml:.github/workflows/aws.yml
name: AWS CI

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: "yarn"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile

      - name: Build project
        env:
          EXPORT: 1
        run: yarn build

      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.CICD_AWS_ACCESS_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.CICD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: eu-west-1

      - name: Sync with S3
        run: aws s3 sync ./out s3://${{ secrets.CICD_AWS_S3_BUCKET }}

      - name: Invalidate CloudFront cache
        run: aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ${{ secrets.CICD_AWS_DISTRIBUTION_ID }} --paths "/*"

```
- In the GitHub Settings under Secrets and variables, add the following values:
    - "CICD_AWS_ACCESS_ID": Access ID for the cicd user
    - "CICD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY": Access Secret for the cicd user
    - "CICD_AWS_S3_BUCKET": blog
    - "CICD_AWS_DISTRIBUTION_ID": CloudFront distribution ID

After completing these steps, your SSG site will be automatically deployed through AWS CloudFront.
