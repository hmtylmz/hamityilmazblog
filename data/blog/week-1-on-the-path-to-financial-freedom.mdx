Today marks my first week on the journey to financial freedom. It was a bit of a slow week, but I believe it was productive.

I found an open-source Next.js blog project. I took it and customized it to fit my needs. My website still has many missing features, but I released it following the process I described in the blog post about SSG release. I also wrote a blog post titled Who Am I.

### Summary

- I launched [hamityilmaz.com](https://hamityilmaz.com).
- I wrote two blog posts.
  - [Who Am I? A Modern Slave or Nobody?](/blog/who-am-i-a-modern-slave-or-nobody)
  - [Guide to Deploying an SSG Site with CloudFront](/blog/guide-to-deploying-an-ssg-site-with-cloudfront)

Future Plans: My blog currently lacks a newsletter feature and multilingual support. I plan to add these and write more blog posts.

See you next time!
